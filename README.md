# Personal Portfolio Website
### Objective:

Create a single-page website showcasing your profile, interests, and skills.

### Skills Used:

- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- CSS for styling (colors, fonts, layouts using `div`, `class`, and `id`).
- Responsive design (basic media queries or inline-block layouts).
- Links (navigation menu linking to sections with IDs).
- Images (e.g., a profile picture or hobby-related images).
- Lists (e.g., for skills or interests).

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Structure:** Create a semantic structure with `<header>` (name and title), `<nav>` (menu with links to sections), `<section>` (about, skills, hobbies), and `<footer>` (contact info).
2. **Content:** Add a profile image, a short bio in `<p>`, and an unordered list (`<ul>`) of skills or hobbies.
3. **Styling:** Use CSS to style the page (e.g., center the content, add a background color, style the nav with hover effects).
4. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the layout adjusts for mobile devices using inline-block or simple media queries.
5. **Bonus:** Add a favicon and a page title reflecting Sameerâ€™s name.
